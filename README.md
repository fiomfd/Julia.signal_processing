# Julia.signal_processing
Here are some examples of Julia programs for signal processing. 

- signal.jl a discrete time signal x(t) = sin(2t(t-3)(t-6)(t-9)(t-12))
- signal_fft.jl the standard discrete Fourier transform
- signal_fft_shifted.jl the shifted graph of the DFT
- signal_stft.jl the spectrogram, i.e., the discrete short-time Fourier transform
- signal_haar.jl the multiresolution decomposition
